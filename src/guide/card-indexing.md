ESP-DASH <span style="color: rgb(245, 75, 66)">Pro</span> provides you with a `setIndex` function in both cards and charts to modify the position of them on the dashboard. 


```cpp
card1.setIndex(0);
```


Indexing in Pro version works in ascending format. The lowest card index will be placed in the front of the list and the highest index will be put in the end. It allows you to set the layout according to your wish.
